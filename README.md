# Game Queue Discord Bot

This is a discord bot that allows the user to create and manage queues of all sorts within a discord server.  

Written in Javascript

## Usage

In order to use this code in your own server, you must follow the directions on discord's website to create your own bot.  
Once you have created your own bot, find your bot's Authorization Token on discord's bot creation website. Paste that token at the bottom of main.js in the space provided. Then invite your bot to your server.  
Once the bot is in the server, you need to host the bot. Once the bot is hosted, you will see it come online on your discord server, and the commands will be ready to use.  
In order to get started with the commands, type -help in your discord server's chat. This will open up a menu explaining all of the bot's capabilities.

## Backstory

I decided to create this bot in order to fix an issue that my friends and I were constantly running in to.  
We all love to stay in touch through our shared discord server's text channels. About 20 of us use them to talk to each other daily. Due to this, however, it is very easy for a particular text message to be lost among other messages. If this message was from someone looking to find a few friends to play a game, then that individual may never be able to get their game going.  
The purpose of this bot is to allow a discord user to start a queue with a descriptive name, signalling to others that they are trying to form a group.   
Users who may not have the time to read every chat message in the server can then simply login and check all active queues to see if anyone is currently playing a game that they might be interested in.  
Overall, the bot has successfully solved our problem, and I hope it can solve yours too.
